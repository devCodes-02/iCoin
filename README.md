# Coin Collector Game

A fun browser-based game where you catch falling coins and dodge bombs!

## About This Project

Hey! I'm a 16-year-old who just started learning JavaScript and wanted to build something cool. This is my first real game project and I learned SO MUCH while making it. Like, I didn't even know how canvas worked before this, and now I can draw stuff and make it move around. Pretty awesome tbh.

## What It Does

- Catch gold coins to score points
- Dodge the bombs or you lose lives
- Golden coins give you 10 points instead of 1
- Blue power coins give you a shield for 5 seconds + 50 points
- Game gets harder as you level up
- Your high score gets saved so you can try to beat it later

## How to Play

1. Just open `https://i-coin.netlify.app/` in your browser
2. Use arrow keys (← →) to move left and right
3. Catch coins, avoid bombs
4. Don't miss too many coins or you'll lose lives!

## Files

- `index.html` - Main page
- `style.css` - Makes it look colorful
- `script.js` - All the game logic

## What I Learned

- How to use HTML5 Canvas for drawing
- JavaScript game loops and animation
- Collision detection (this was tricky!)
- Making things spawn randomly
- Using localStorage to save high scores

Took me a while to figure out the collision detection and making the bombs actually show up was harder than I thought lol. But I got it working eventually!

Made while learning JavaScript - if you see any bugs just know I'm still learning dude
